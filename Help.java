	INTRODUCTION:
	
	AI Generation II is a long awaited powerful tool. You can use it to create your own AI, that has an assigned career, or a single job. How? This software
	operates in a block format. Careers are the componets of jobs. Jobs are the componets of tasks. Tasks are the componets of instructions. 
	This is possible by having databases in the form of classes. Each database class is like a block. Open each database class, and study the format. It is 
	very simple and straightforward. If you are new to Java, you can buy a Java ebook for less than $5 USD. For those who want solid results, automation,
	and a reliable employee, it may take days, or weeks to build the required base blocks (instructions). Thanks for choosing EMILE'S TECHNOLOGIES LLC for 
	your AI desires!
	
	
	
	
	
	CREDITS:
	
	This AI was engineered, and made entirely by Emile Dominique of EMILE'S TECHNOLOGIES LLC. This software is free of charge, and does not cost anything.
	
	
	
	
	
	HOW TO CONFIGURE WORK SCHEDULE:
	
	This software is designed to do work, following a schedule. When configuring the work schedule, goto the Main.java file. At the top of the file, you
	will see some configuration variables. You can set your schedule where it says "WORK SCHEDULE - 24 HOUR TIME". The time hours must be within the 24
	hour cycle. Otherwise, an error will occur. You must also enter the days that the AI should work. 
	
	
	
	
	
	HOW TO MAKE THE AI WORK:
	
	First, you need to create instructions. You can do that by heading over to the "Instruction_Database.java" file, and creating objects, of simple actions.
	This is the most important part, because the instructions are the building blocks that will make the AI work. You can make unlimited instructions.
	
	Second, you need to goto the "Task_Database.java" file, and create a object with the task name.. In that task, you will place your instructions for that task.
 	You can make unlimited tasks.
	
	Third, open "Job_Database.java" and create a object with the job name. In that object, place the tasks for the job. You can make unlimited jobs.
	
	Fourth, to constuct a career, open the "Career_Database.java" file, and create a object, with the career name. In that object, place the jobs for that
	career. Only 1 career is recommended per employee, but you can create as many as you like.
	
	
	
	
	
	DATA SAFETY:
	
	This software does NOT use cookies, trackers, or collect any data. The program is strictly OFFLINE. No account is needed to use this software.
	
	
	
	
	
	AUTO BACKUP:
	
	If you choose to use auto backup, you must set a directory for the backup on lines 190, 209, and 230 of the "Auto_Backup.java" file.
